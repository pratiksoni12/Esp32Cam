This code is designed to configure an ESP32-CAM module to capture images and upload them to a server using HTTP POST requests. Below is a breakdown of its functionality:

Key Features:
Wi-Fi Configuration:

Connects the ESP32-CAM to a Wi-Fi network using specified credentials (ssid and password).
Configures a static IP address to ensure the device always uses the same IP.
Camera Initialization:

Configures the AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM module's camera pins.
Sets the resolution, JPEG quality, and frame buffer count based on the availability of PSRAM (to optimize memory usage).
Image Capture:

Captures an image from the camera using the esp_camera_fb_get() function.
Logs the size of the captured image for debugging purposes.
Image Upload:

Uses the HTTPClient library to send the captured image to a specified server endpoint (serverURL).
Sends the image in binary format with appropriate headers, including a Device-ID to identify the ESP32-CAM.
Periodic Task:

After each image upload, the ESP32-CAM waits for 3 minutes before capturing and uploading the next image. This interval can be adjusted.
Applications:
This setup can be used in scenarios such as:

Remote Monitoring: Sending images to a central server for surveillance or monitoring.
IoT Projects: Integration with IoT systems for data logging and analysis.
Time-Lapse Photography: Capturing images periodically to create time-lapse videos.
